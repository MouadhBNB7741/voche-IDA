# Annex III: Technical Roadmap & MVP Architecture

## 1. Executive Summary of Technology

To support VOCE’s dual mission of **engagement** (community building) and **evidence generation** (data science), the technical architecture has been upgraded from a standard MERN stack to a **Data-First Stack (React + Python + SQL)**.

This shift ensures that the platform is ready for AI integration (via Python) and complex relational data management (via PostgreSQL) from Day 1, ensuring scalability for global clinical trial standards.

## 2. The Tech Stack (PERN - Python Edition)

| Component | Technology | Rationale for VOCE |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Frontend** | **React.js (Vite)** | Ensures a responsive, mobile-first interface optimized for low-bandwidth environments in LMICs. |
| **Backend** | **Python (FastAPI)** | High-performance API framework. Native support for data science libraries (Pandas, NumPy), making future AI/Chatbot integration seamless. |
| **Database** | **PostgreSQL** | Robust relational database. Essential for managing complex relationships between **Patients ↔ Trials ↔ Hospitals ↔ Consent Forms**. |
| **ORM** | **SQLAlchemy** | Manages database interactions securely, preventing SQL injection attacks. |
| **Search** | **Full-Text Search (Postgres)** | Built-in search capabilities to query clinical trials by disease and location without external dependencies. |
| **Infra** | **Docker** & **AWS/Cloud** | Containerized deployment ensures the app runs identically on local dev machines and global servers. |

## 3. MVP Developer Roadmap

This roadmap is strictly scoped to the **Minimum Viable Product**. Features are prioritized based on the "Golden Rule": *Does this feature connect a user to a trial or educate them on advocacy?*

### PHASE 1: Core Infrastructure & Compliance

**Objective:** Secure foundation with privacy-by-design.

* **Repo & Env Setup:** Initialize Monorepo with React (Frontend) and FastAPI (Backend).
* **Security Layer:**
* Implement **HIPAA/GDPR-compliant** database encryption (at rest and in transit).
* Set up **Consent Manager Middleware**: Enforces that no user data is written to the DB without explicit, granular consent.


* **API Gateway:** Establish RESTful API structure (`/api/v1/`) with rate limiting to prevent abuse.
* **Interoperability:** Define data models compliant with **FHIR** standards (mocked structure for MVP).

### PHASE 2: Identity & Access Management (RBAC)

**Objective:** Secure, role-based access for diverse stakeholders.

* **Auth Architecture:**
* Implementation of **OAuth2 with JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for stateless, secure session management.
* Password hashing using `bcrypt`.


* **User Roles (RBAC):**
* **Patient:** Anonymous browsing + Registration for "Saved Trials."
* **HCP:** Registration with "Verification Flag" (Medical License ID field).
* **Admin:** Dashboard access for content moderation.


* **Onboarding Logic:**
* Dynamic tagging system: Patients select "Disease Interests" (e.g., HIV, Malaria) during signup to personalize the feed.



### PHASE 3: The Clinical Trial Navigator (The Engine)

**Objective:** The core value proposition—connecting people to trials.

* **Database Schema:**
* Creation of Relational Tables: `Trials`, `Locations`, `Inclusion_Criteria`, `Sponsors`.


* **Data Ingestion:**
* Development of a **Bulk Upload Tool (CSV/JSON)** for Admins to curate and upload trial data manually (Scraping automated in V2).


* **Search Engine:**
* FastAPI endpoint with query parameters: `GET /trials?disease=TB&country=South_Africa`.
* Frontend filters for **Status** (Recruiting/Closed) and **Phase** (I-IV).



### PHASE 4: Engagement & Education Hubs

**Objective:** Building community literacy and trust.

* **Resource Library (CMS):**
* Admin interface to upload PDF toolkits and video links.
* Tagging system for "Advocacy," "Ethics," and "Trial Literacy."


* **Forums (MVP Lite):**
* Threaded discussions (`Topic` > `Post` > `Reply`).
* **Moderation Tools:** "Report Content" flag (Critical for preventing medical misinformation).



### PHASE 5: AI Assistant & Intelligence

**Objective:** Scalable support and insight generation.

* **The VOCE Assistant (Rule-Based):**
* Python-based logic (not yet Generative AI to ensure safety).
* *Logic Flow:* User queries "Consent" -> Bot returns link to "Informed Consent Module."


* **Analytics Dashboard:**
* Backend logs for "Most Searched Diseases" and "Resource Download Rates" to inform IDA policy strategy.



### PHASE 6: Pilot & Launch Readiness

**Objective:** Deployment and localization.

* **Localization (i18n):**
* Frontend support for **English + 1 Priority Language** (e.g., French or Spanish).


* **Beta Group:**
* Onboarding of 50 Patients + 10 HCPs for User Acceptance Testing (UAT).


* **Feedback Loop:**
* "Suggest a Feature" / "Report a Bug" prominent UI elements.
